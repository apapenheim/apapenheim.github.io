  <h1>Avant-propos</h1>

<p>TheRedChannel is a cybercarnet about state-makers, mark-makers, and state marks by <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}">Andrew Papenheim</a>. That is: visual identity, branded communications, the people who make them, and the people who use them. It is also more of a general exercise in <a href="http://duckofminerva.com/2012/02/egghead.html">the art of egg gathering</a>. Andrew's New Year's resolution was to tweet less. Blogs, essentially tweetstorms to which – blissfully – the reader cannot readily reply, are a decent erstaz. Thanks for visiting.</p>
