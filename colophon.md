# Conditions of Service

**It is scary out there on the internet.** Anything can happen to you. Better read this and decide if you wish to continue.

Access to `papenhe.im` is provided without prejudice, and for the exclusive use and benefit of the Visitor. Your continued access to the Service is conditioned on compliance with the terms set forth herein. Any person or firm that accesses the Service through any mechanism is strictly bound by these conditions. Accessing the Service constitutes an agreement to these terms. Should you find something unpalatable and disagree, do discontinue your access to the Service immediately.

## Acceptable Use

A Visitor shall not – and will not permit others to – engage in proscribed activities, which include, but are not limited to:
* any action taken in attempt to obtain that to which they are not duly entitled
* any interference or attempting to interfere with uninterrupted access to the Service
* any breach or attempted breach of any security measures, or 
* assisting person(s) engaging in any activity seen above.

## Dispute Settlement Mechanism

Does not exist. The Operator is Leviathan. See Termination.

## Termination

The Operator reserves the right to, without any prior notice and without liability, terminate a Visitor's access to part or all of the Service for any reason. Anything at all. That includes being in breach of terms.

Should a Visitor find themselves in a position where access has been terminated, they are not off the hook for the remainder of the terms that by their nature would survive termination. (See, without limitation and among others, clauses pertaining to indemnity.)

## Third-party Links

The Service contains links to third-party resources outside of my exclusive purview. The Operator is not clairvoyant, and as such has no idea how they will behave at the time a Visitor accesses them. The Operator assumes no responsibility for the content, standards, or practices of those particular sites and services.

The Visitor further acknowledges and agrees that the Operator shall not be held in any way responsible or liable for the content of those links, or for damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused in connection with the use of any such content available on or through any third-party web sites or services.

## Jurisdiction and Governing Law

Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Québec in Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Should a provision of the terms be found invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions do still apply. Under no circumstance is a declination on the part of the Operator  to enforce a provision of the terms governing this Serviceto be construed as a waiver of the right to do so.

## Revisions

At any time and at the Operator's sole discretion, these terms may be modified, replaced, or superseded. This includes material revisions, which enter into force 15 days after date of publication. What constitutes a material revision is determined under the Operator's enlightened judgement, not yours. Continued access to the Service following effective modification of terms is agreement to be bound by those terms.

# Privacy Policy

What follows is notice of the policy with respect to collection, use, and disclosure of personal data which may arise when using the Service, as well the rights and responsibilities the Operator assumes. 

Look, it is really simple. **This is a static site.** I, as Operator, do not have the infrastructure to collect your personal data. I do not desire to gain that capability, either.

## Information Collection and Use

The Service does not collect or retain any type of personal information for any purpose.

## Service Providers

The Service may employ third-party products to facilitate its operations. These third parties may have their own Privacy Policy and may request a Visitor's Personal Data to perform tasks related to, but without principal involvement of, this Service. The Visitor is strongly encouraged to review the Privacy Policy of any website requesting their Personal Data.

## Third-party Links

The Service contains external links to other sites not under the Operator's management. The Operator has no control over – and assumes no responsibility for – the content, policies, or practices of any third-party entity.

## Types of Data Collected

### Personal Data

* Nope.

### Cookies and Usage Data

* Not on this website, bub.

## Revisions

This policy may be modified from time to time. Notification of any changes will be made through the publication of new policies on this page. Since the Service does not collect your e-mail address and does not intend to start, it is structurally incapable of providing that form of notification. Thus, it is best advised to periodically review this policy for changes. Consider it akin to a legislative gazette. Changes are effective immediately upon publication to this page.
